# Benitez-Alvarez_et_al_2025_Gene_repertoire_evolution_land_planarians
# 1. Description:
This repository contains the scripts and files (inputs, intermediates, and outputs)  needed to reproduce the analysis in: Benítez-Álvarez et al. 2025. Genomic exaptation and regulatory landscape shifts as key mechanisms enabling flatworm terrestrialization. Additionally, you can find several supplementary files for a better understanding of results.

# 2. Directories in this repository

**1_OMA:** This directory contains the files correspondent to the longest isoforms belonging to S. mediterranea (SMED3) and Obama nungara (ONUN2), data not included in matedb2. Additionally, you can find the species tree used to run the orthologs inference with OMA and the orthoxml file, output of this analysis

**2_Proteomics:** Raquel add description

**3_DGE_stats:** Klara add description

**4_Supplementary_Material:** This directory contains supplemntary material supporting results  (waiting final files)
